     * Exercise 1.
     * Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string.
     * It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method.
     * Since the counting operation can be time consuming, the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously
     * encountered,it will simply retrieve the stored result.
     * Use collections and maps where appropriate.

    /**
     * Exercise 2.
     * Write a program which creates a concordance of characters occurring in a string (i.e., which characters occur where in a string).
     * Read the string from the command line.
     *
     * Running the program:
     *
     * >java Concordance Hello World
     * {d=[9], o=[4, 6], r=[7], W=[5], H=[0], l=[2, 3, 8], e=[1]}
